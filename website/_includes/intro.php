	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p class="p-1">Myofascial release is a safe and very effective hands-on technique that involves application of gentle sustained pressure into myofascial connective tissue restrictions. This unique manual therapy is a whole body approach designed to eliminate pain, restore motion, improve flexibility, posture and function.</p> 

	<p>Myofascial release is a specialized treatment technique which differs from standard occupational and physical therapy, massage, and chiropractic care. Many patients seek out myofascial release after standard therapies have not provided the desired results of pain relief and restoration of mobility and function.</p>

	<p>Wild Sage Myofascial Release Therapy provides a comprehensive approach to treating myofascial restrictions. Therapist and patient work together as team to maximize therapy results.</p>

	<p>Wild Sage Myofascial Release Therapy follows the myofascial release technique developed by John Barnes, a physical therapist. For more information on John Barnes and myofascial release you can visit his <a class="nor" href="http://www.myofascialrelease.com" target="_blank">website here</a></p>

	<h1 class="top-pad">What are fascial restrictions and what causes them?</h1>
	<p class="p-1">Fascia is the soft tissue component of connective tissue that is prevalent throughout the entire body. It is a three-dimensional web with a unique architectural system surrounding muscle, tendon, ligaments, nerves, blood vessels, and organs which provides stability, structure, cushion, and communication within the body.</p>

	<p>Restrictions in fascia occur through trauma or injury, surgery, inflammatory processes, environmental, positional, and/or emotional stresses. Fascial restrictions create pain and limitations with mobility and range of motion which can significantly impact activities of daily living, work, recreation, and participation in sports. Fascial restrictions are frequently overlooked in traditional medical care as they do not show up on standard medical testing such as Xrays, MRI and CAT scans and are not generally addressed by traditional physical and/or occupational therapy protocols, massage therapy, and chiropractic therapies.</p>

	<p>Many traumas, injuries, repetitive and sustained positions (such as computer work, texting, cycling, skiing, rock climbing) can create shortening of our connective (fascia) tissue. Bracing and holding patterns can develop over a period of years creating further pain and debilitation. Traditional outpatient therapy generally treats the localized area of pain, but frequently does not address the fascial connective tissue dysfunction which results in continued pain and dysfunction.</p>
